Features and Change
===================

+ Features (feature-based) vs. Sprints (time-based)
+ Changes *are* features
+ Features without documentation might as well not exist
+ Avoid surprises for your end-users

  - Surprises turn people away
  - Surprised users may not come back

Managing Change
===============

+ Change is contentious
+ Change things sanely, with ample warning
+ Document **everything**
+ You don't know everything, and new-comers definitely do not
+ Learn to live w/ Murphy's Law

  - Document retrospectives/post-mortems
  - Opportunities to share what you learned

+ Set expectations

  - Transparency is essential
  - Be forthcoming in your communication
  - Surprises: scary; Invitations: awesome
