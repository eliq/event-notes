The Gist
========

+ Text-width of 76-79 is perfecto!

Consistent style
================

+ Breaking function calls/defs that are multiline into 
+ Always add a trailing comma to all containers::

    foo(
        thing1='thing1',
        thing2=thing2,
    )

    - Revision control loves this!

Type Checking

+ Refactor your names and you get "free type checking" by way of consistency

Explicitness
============
