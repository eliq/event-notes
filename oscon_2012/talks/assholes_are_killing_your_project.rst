The Gist
========

+ Community is critical
+ Results depends on community
+ Reputation -> Contributors -> Results -> Reputation...
+ "The best" of the community convince you to join
+ Basically 5/6 people have to not be assholes
+ 1 bad is "offset" by 5 good
+ Provide expectations and lead by example!
