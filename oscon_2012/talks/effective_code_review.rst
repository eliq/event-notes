*Everyone should do code review!*

+ Everyone who codes should be involved

Why?
====

+ You write better code when you know it will be judged
+ More than one person **understands** the code
+ A great way to learn the codebase

What to look for
================

+ Bad design
+ Lack fo clarity or conformity (style)
+ Performance hazards (iterators, leaks)

What's not important
====================

+ Optimization (premature!)
+ Skill & experience gaps (e.g. novice reviewing expert's code)
+ Personal style ("that's now how *I* would have done it")

When
====

+ Fit code review into the dev cycle
+ Ad hoc ("is there a better way to ...")
+ Fisheye is a great tool

Remote Teams
============

+ Acts as a REAL status update
+ Helps manage async coding
+ Builds trust & morale

How to sell it to others
========================

+ Not as hard as unit tests!
+ Bottom-up approach ("hey check this code, let me know")
+ JUST DO IT

Tips
====

+ Solo projects are no exception!
+ Try providing feedback to others and asking for feedback in trade
+ Don't try to define goals, but rather track your direction

  + "This is the direction we're going... are we ok with it?" vs.
  + "We should have 173 lines of code per developer per day"
