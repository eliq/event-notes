The Gist
========

1. IT is dead
2. Convergence
3. Profit!!

The Meat
========

+ Traditional SysAdmins are like human bowling pin-setters: obsolete
+ "Doing things right" vs. "doing the right things"
+ Effects in play

  + The Network Effect (aka Metcalf's Law)
  + The Edge Effect (the more different things, the better)
  + Meatware (real people)

+ Laws in effect

  + Nielson's Law (bandwidth) vs. Kryder's Law (storage density)
  + "The Mobility Gap" between storage and bandwidth
  + Moore's Law (computing power)

+ The Internet is a DAG (Direct Acyclic Graph)
+ If we have quantum computing, we have no crypto: Time to rethink!
+ Post-convergence for PC (e.g. Apple -> Pagemaker)

Summary
=======

+ Things are interesting, new, and exciting in this era.
+ The goal is to make your platform boring!
